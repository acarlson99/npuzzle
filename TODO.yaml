TODO:
  - Validation:
    - Stress test fileio
    - Quit if puzzle not solvable
  - Search:
    - Implement more heuristic algorithms (linear conflict)
  - Bonus:
    - Fix issue with sizing.  Perhaps add buf on both all sides of tiles

DONE:
  - Validation:
    - Check if solvable
    - Fix solvable check
  - Search:
    - Record data about search
    - Implement greedy search
    - Implement uniform-cost search
    - Fix A* algorithm # done I think
    - Properly update information when nodes conflict # pretty sure this is good
  - Bonus:
    - Visualizer?
    - Fix leaks
  - Other:
    - fix go.mod to account for gui stuff
